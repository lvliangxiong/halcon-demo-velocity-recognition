#### Using halcon to generate position data from images

`demo.hdev` consists the image processing codeï¼Œwhich run on the `Halcon` environment. Make sure images are put into the `images` folder at the same level of  `demo.hdev`.

A sample image:

To compute the velocity of the target requires a few pictures, which consumes much space, so here I just give you a sample picture.

Main principle of this image processing code is to recognize the target by color threshold, then compute its contour center and orientation. Final results will outputted as a `Points.dat` file in the `images` folder. 

The `demo.hdev` run on the `Halcon`  is like this:

#### Using Matlab to compute velocity

With positions, compute velocity can be an easy stuff. But the main obstacle lies in that the positions obtained are really noisy-filled data. This can be very severe especially when at an high image shot rate (frames). 

To handle this, two approaches based on a mean-median filter and Butterworth filter respectively are implemented in Matlab, detail in `main_medfilt.m` and `main_butter.m`.

Sample results are shown below:

As you can see, the raw result is terrible, but after filtering, it seems much better. For sure, appropriate filter parameters should find by yourself.
